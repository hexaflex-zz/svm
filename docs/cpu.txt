 CPU & Architecture
===============================================================================

 Manufacturer:  0xFFFE
 Serialno.:     0x0001
 Document rev.: 16


 The CPU clock frequency is unbounded and limited by the host system and
 implementation. It has 65,536 bytes of byte-addressable memory and 12 builtin
 registers. Address values are 16 bits and so are all but one register.

      |      | 
      |      | a: compare flag; used by comparison instructions. 
      |      | b: overflow flag; set when certain arithmetic 
      |      |    operations overflow. 
      |      | c: division by zero flag. 
      |      | 
      |      | Remaining bits are unused and reserved for future use.

 Directly writing to RSP, RIP or RST can have undesirable side effects and
 should be avoided.

 Instructions
================================================================================

 Operands can be either numeric literals, label names, registers or named
 constants. Unless otherwise stated, non-address operands are treated as signed
 values.

 Instruction Encoding
================================================================================

 Instructions are variable width. Meaning they encode to varying binary sizes,
 depending on the number- and type of their operands. The smallest being 1 byte
 and the widest being 10 bytes. The bit layout is as follows:

   aaaaaaaa bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbb
            cccccccc cccccccc cccccccc
            dddddddd dddddddd dddddddd

	a: 8 bit opcode.
   b: 0-, 8-, 24-bit operand A.
   c: 0-, 8-, 24-bit operand B.
   d: 0-, 8-, 24-bit operand C.

 Layout of an operand:

   aacccccc dddddddd dddddddd

   a: 2 bit operand address mode:
      0 = constant
      1 = address
      2 = register
   c: 6-bit operand value iff a is 2.
   d: 16-bit operand value iff a is 0 or 1.


================================================================================
 Hardware devices & Interrupts
================================================================================

 A CPU can connect to- and interact with hardware peripherals. Code can call
 functions on a given device using the INT instruction. Operands for these
 operations are passed through the general purpose registers. Which operands a
 given operation requires, is explained in the documentation for the respective
 device. The single argument for the INT instruction is the address where the
 device is mapped. Where a specific device is mapped can be discovered using the
 HWA instruction.

 Alternatively, each device can trigger a hardware interrupt on the CPU if it
 is configured to do so. For this to work, the program must set the RIA
 register to a valid non-zero address which forms the entrypoint for a custom
 interrupt handler. Each device that should be allowed to trigger interrupts,
 should be given a unique Interrupt Id through a INT operation. Once this
 id is assigned, the device is free to send an interrupt request to the CPU
 whenever necessary to fullfill a specific purpose. What this purpose is,
 depends on the device and is explain in the respective device documentation.

 Each interrupt request is added to a queue by the CPU. The queue has a maximum
 capacity of 32. Any interrupt requests sent when the queue is full, will be
 silently ignored. Each execution step, the CPU will check the queue for any
 pending messages and if found, will hand program control to the interrupt
 handler defined in RIA. Once this handler is finished, control returns to
 where it left off.
 
 Note: the CPU treats a hardware interrupt as a CALL instruction to the handler
 defined in RIA. One should therefore ensure the handler ends with a RET
 instruction.

 Note: When the handler is executed, the CPU creates a callstack backup of R0
 register and then sets the register to the Interrupt Id provided by the
 hardware making the request. Once the handler returns, the R0 register should
 manually be restored using a POP instruction. 


================================================================================
 Error conditions
================================================================================

 Whenever a program encounters an error, the system crashes.
 This happens under the following conditions:

 * Trying to jump to- or begin execution at an invalid memory address.
 * Attempting to trigger an interrupt on an unknown device.
