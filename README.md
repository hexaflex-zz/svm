## SVM

SVM implements a programmable virtual machine for a fictional 16-bit architecture.
It comes with an assembler and the runtime. The runtime contains the CPU and a
number of virtual hardware peripherals which one can interact with through a 
program. These include, among other things, a sprite-based display and a gamepad.

Refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory for details on the assembly
language, the architecture and how to interact with peripherals.
